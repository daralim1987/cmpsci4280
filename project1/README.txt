I am using option 1. 

To run my program after typed make command, there are two options:
1. Take the input from standard keyboard input type ./build/scanner
2. Take the input from the input file type ./build/scanner < filename.input1
	(Were filename can be replaced with whatever file name you want to test but the extension have to be .input1).

Other than the specified above, program will display and error messages.
